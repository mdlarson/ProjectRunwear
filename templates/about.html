            <p>I created this site because I often can't remember what weather feels like, especially when I'm running
                and working up a sweat. And the problem got worse when this Atlantan moved to Brooklyn, and had to
                figure out what works well for longer, colder winters! I previously kept a note on my phone with outfits
                at each temperature range, which I would consult after checking my local weather. I created this site to
                save myself a step. :)</p>

            <p>I'm particularly grateful for winter clothing recommendations from <a
                    href="https://tinamuir.com/summer-running-what-to-wear/">Tina Muir</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.runtothefinish.com/what-to-wear-winter-running/">Amanda Brooks</a>. Their advice
                helped me discern my favorite outfits. And <a href="http://dressmyrun.com/">Dress My Run</a> was a clear
                and useful inspiration for this more personal version.</p>
